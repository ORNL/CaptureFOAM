# CaptureFOAM
CaptureFOAM provides utilities for fast and accurate direct air capture (DAC) contactor simulations, based on the OpenFOAM framework. At the core, CaptureFOAM is a suite of mass transfer and chemistry models built upon the OpenFOAM thin film model, which allows coarser mesh resolution and less constrictive time step requirements when compared to a traditional volume of fluid approach. This allows CaptureFOAM to conduct device-scale simulations for complex geometries including commercial packing materials and novel contactor shapes, matching experimental results in a wide variety of applications.
